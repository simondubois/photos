## FAQ

### How to upload photos?

> This feature is not implemented, and there is no plan to implement it in the future. This is a [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) project focusing on displaying photos, not managing files.
>
> To upload photos, you have several options:
> - (S)FTP or any file manager provided by your hosting.
> - sync a server folder with a local folder.
> - sync a server folder with a file hosting service.
> - sync a server folder with a personal cloud service.
> - fork the project and implement the feature.

### What about performances?

> On download, the application resizes, interlaces and encodes to JPG (quality 50) the photo. The resulting file is cached by the server on disk and by the client for the same duration. The cache duration is the difference between the current datetime and the date of the photo. So a photo which is one week old will be cached for one week.
>
>To clear server cache, run the following command: `php artisan cache:clear`.

### What about authentication?

> Authentication either requires a database or an external service. Also, authentication requires additional features like lost passwords and account activation.
> This is a [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) project focusing on displaying photos, avoiding any complexity.
>
> If you want authentication, I recommend you to setup [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) at the server level.

### How to change the theme?

> You can easily switch to any other [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme:
> 1. Run `npm install` to install all frontend dependencies.
> 2. Open `resources/app.scss`
> 3. Replace the two occurences to `sketchy` with the template namce of your choice.
> 4. Run `npm run dev` to compile the assets with the new theme.
> VoilÃ !

### Why are the CSS/JS files not optimized?

> There is a [known issue](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/issues/878) preventing Bootswatch Sketchy theme to compile in production build.
